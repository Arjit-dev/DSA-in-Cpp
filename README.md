# DSA Practice in C++ ðŸ’»

This repository contains my personal DSA and competitive programming practice solutions in C++.  
I solve problems across various platforms and organize them by topic.

## Platforms
- LeetCode
- Codeforces
- GeeksForGeeks

## Topics Covered
- Arrays
- Strings
- Linked Lists
- Dynamic Programming
- Trees & Graphs
- Bit Manipulation

## My Commit Strategy
I commit every 1-2 days. Each commit represents a meaningful solution or a small topic grind.

## Tools Used
- Language: C++
- Optional: Catch2 for testing
- Optional: GitHub Actions to auto-test

## Notes
Some folders may contain notes or markdowns summarizing the approach used, edge cases, and time complexity.
